# src/__init__.py
# This file marks the 'src' directory as a Python package.
# No specific content is typically needed here for this setup,
# but if you have common imports or initializations, they can go here.

# Based on your content, it seems you intended to import functions, not classes.
# The original error was `from .content_generator import ContentGenerator`
# but your content_generator.py likely defines a function `generate_content`.
# Let's keep it simple and clean. No explicit imports are necessary here
# for the way main.py calls functions from other modules.
# If you were making a larger application with shared components, this might be used.

# For now, an empty __init__.py is sufficient to mark 'src' as a package.
# All specific imports should be done in the files where they are used (e.g., main.py).
